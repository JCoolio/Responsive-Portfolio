        <p>I am an uber nerd turned entreprenuer. Starting my own brand Locally HaTXed back in 2016 focusing on the Houston Car scene. After
        rapid growth we reached out into other feilds covering model, creating apparel, and supporting local community events even local artists like Blank Faces. </p><br>
        <p>Seeing my work and ideas being appreciated
        made me want to do more with the time and resources i had. Learning to dabble in code at a younger age thanks to the age of technology we live with video games having become so personal that customization and localized hosting is
        at its peak,luckily for me i learned quick. I did a vast amount of video game modifications that ranged from as simple as hosting a mincraft server with custom mods to as hard as changing live data in Call Of Duty multiplayer. As good as those times were
        it was time to put down the games atleast for now and focus on my education. My main focus now is to complete the education level I'm at to support the future of my education and personal endevaurs.</p><br>
